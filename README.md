# space-soldier
A procedurally generated topdown shooter created in Unity2D and C#.

This game is somewhat of a playground for me in that I'm using it to learn Unity and to experiment with different game technologies/algorithms. It's playable right now but not yet presentable - needs a serious aesthetic overhaul before I am ready to show it to the world.
